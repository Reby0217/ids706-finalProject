   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   make docker-run-front
   ```
3. Visit the application in your browser at: [http://localhost:5085/](http://localhost:5085/) 

---

#### Option 2: Using a Virtual Environment
1. Install `virtualenv`:
   ```bash
   pip3 install virtualenv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=run.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   ```
6. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the application:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   flask run
   ```
7. Visit the application in your browser at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

### Data Engineering Compliance

This project utilizes **SQLAlchemy**, a Python SQL toolkit that allows developers to access and manage SQL databases using Pythonic domain language. All data is stored in a lightweight SQLite database located at `frontend/apps/db.sqlite3`.

1. **Database Management**:
   - The project defines and manages database models like `Users` and `OAuth` using SQLAlchemy, enabling efficient CRUD operations and managing relationships with `ForeignKey` and `relationship`.

   - **Users Table Overview**:
      - **id**: Unique identifier for each user (primary key).  
      - **username**: Unique username for the user.  
      - **email**: Unique email address.  
      - **password**: Securely hashed password.  
      - **oauth_github**: Optional GitHub OAuth identifier.  
      - **api_token**: Authentication token for API access.  
      - **api_token_ts**: Timestamp of token creation.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - User data, authentication tokens, and OAuth details are stored in the SQLite database, providing a portable and reliable storage solution.

3. **Authentication and Security**:
   - **hashlib** ensures secure password storage with hashing and salting techniques.  
   - **PyJWT** enables token-based authentication, generating and validating secure JSON Web Tokens.

4. **Data Validation and Querying**:
   - SQLAlchemy's query interface supports dynamic data retrieval and filtering, critical for user authentication and API workflows.  
   - Form inputs for login and registration are validated to ensure clean and consistent database records.

### Load Test

#### Objective
To verify our microservice's capacity to handle significant traffic, we performed scaled-down load tests using Apache Bench.

#### Testing Method
- **100 Requests Test:**
  ```bash
  ab -n 100 -c 10 https://bnnt5hhvdc.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/
  ```
   ![image](imgs/loadtest1.png)
- **1,000 Requests Test:**
  ```bash
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://bnnt5hhvdc.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/
  ```
  ![image](imgs/loadtest2.png)

#### Rationale
Given the project's scope and budget constraints, tests with 100 and 1,000 requests were deemed sufficient to demonstrate the microserviceâ€™s scalability and performance capabilities. Testing up to the full requirement of 10,000 requests per second was considered cost-prohibitive for this academic exercise, as confirmed by our teaching assistant.

#### Results
Both tests confirmed efficient handling of increased loads, indicating that our service can scale up effectively when needed.

### Flask Integration

This project utilizes **Flask**, to build the application's core functionality. Flask serves as the foundation for handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering dynamic web pages.

Key features include:

- **Routing and Modularization**: The application uses Flask Blueprints to organize features like authentication and API endpoints, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.
- **Dynamic Templating**: Flask integrates seamlessly with HTML templates, enabling dynamic rendering of user interfaces.
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs are implemented using Flask-RESTx to support robust data exchange and user authentication workflows.
- **OAuth Support**: GitHub OAuth login is integrated using Flask-Dance for secure third-party authentication.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK

Our project utilizes the AWS CDK to define and provision our cloud infrastructure, ensuring a consistent, reliable, and secure setup across development, testing, and production environments. AWS CDK allows for declarative infrastructure management using familiar programming languages, enabling version control and reducing deployment errors.

#### Key Features:
- **DynamoDB Tables**: Managed NoSQL databases with specified partition keys.
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless functions for backend operations such as data handling and user authentication.
- **Security**: Explicit permission definitions enhance security and compliance.

#### Code Snippet:
```python
demo_table = aws_dynamodb.Table(
    self, "user_info",
    partition_key=aws_dynamodb.Attribute(name="id", type=aws_dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING),
)

producer_lambda = aws_lambda.Function(
    self, "write_to_dynamodb_lambda_function",
    runtime=aws_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_11,
    code=aws_lambda.Code.from_asset("./lambda/producer"),
)
```
